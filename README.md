# Orbital-launch
Orital launch modeling 

## Goal of this project
Answers the question: What is the escape velocity of a sphere and a projectile considering and disregarding air resistance?

## Scape velocity: 
Minimum speed for a body to be thrown and never fall again;
assuming no energy is added along the way.

## Initial considerations
- Both the sphere and the projectile were considered material points.
- Both do not suffer thermodynamic effects
- Both of them move only on the Y axis in relation to the Earth's surface
- The Earth does not rotate and translate and has a uniform surface

## Conclusion
The difference between the sphere and the projectile, in both surface area and drag coefficient, is only 10 times greater, and this results in a difference in escape velocities of approximately 20 million meters per second

It is impossible for a spherical object to reach escape velocity
